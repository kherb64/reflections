When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Working from multpile computers, share project with other people, backup matters.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I can decide on the time by myself

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forksare from one GitHub repo to another. Clones are from a remote or a local repo to a local one. Bracnhes are all within a local repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Can work offline. Have the latests commits with me.
