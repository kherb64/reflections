What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git directory is created that contains all info to keep track of my files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It shows the new/modified files that are being tracked and are abut to be committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Just add the files that belong to this one logical change.
